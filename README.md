This is my initial github and it contains my solution to assignment #1 in the "Introduction to Computer Science" Java course at Ariel University.
In fact, the code I wrote is a type of calculator that allows the conversion of a number from one base to another.
The calculator can process input strings in the format `<number>b<base>` or directly recognize standalone numbers. Here are some examples: 
1) If I enter as input 1010b2 then I will get 10 as output.
2) If I enter 7bA as input then I will get 7 as output.
3) If I enter as input AbB, then I will get 10 as output.
